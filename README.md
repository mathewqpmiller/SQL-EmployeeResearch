## SQL Database

In this project, I had to review several csv files and understand how they were related to one another.  I then designed table schematas to hold the information from within those csv's.  After that I imported the csv files into SQL databases where I then answered questions about them through specific queries. In this activity I performed:

*Data Modeling

*Data Engineering

*Data Analysis

### Task 1: Data Modeling

In order to build the tables correctly, I needed to understand what was in each csv file and how they were related to one another.  To do this I used a platform call MyGenModel, where I modeled my data in ERD format adressing such things as column names, primary keys and foreign keys.

### Task 2: Data Engineering

Once I understood the csv files I then began to build my tables.  In order to do this I used pgAdmin 4 and created a database for the table schematas.  Here is one example of a table schemata that I created, executed and successfully imported the appropriate csv file into.

### Task 3: Data Analysis

In this portion of the project there was some analysis needed from the table schematas previously created.   My job was to answer eight questions related to the data provided.  Here is an example of one of the questions that was asked and the answer.

Question: List first name, last name, and sex for employees whose first name is "Hercules" and last names begin with "B."
