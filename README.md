# SQL-Employee Database: A Mystery in Two Parts

In this project, I had to review several csv files and understand how they were related to one another.  I then designed table schematas to hold the information from within those csv's.  After that I imported the csv files into SQL databases where I then answered questions about the data through specific queries. In this activity I performed:

*Data Modeling

*Data Engineering

*Data Analysis

## DATA ANALYSIS

In this portion of the project there was some analysis needed from the table schematas previously created.  My job was to answer eight questions related to the data provided.  Here is an example of one of the questions that was asked and the answer

Question 5)  List first name, last name, and sex for employees whose first name is "Hercules" and last names begin with "B."
